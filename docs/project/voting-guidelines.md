### Direct Answer

#### Overview  
Voting systems vary depending on the scenario, with no single "best" system for all cases due to differing goals like fairness, simplicity, or consensus. Research suggests the best system depends on whether you're electing one winner, multiple winners, or making a group decision, and factors like voter preference and representation matter. Here's a breakdown for common scenarios, keeping it simple for easy understanding.

#### Single-Winner Elections (e.g., President, Mayor)  
If you want the winner to have broad support, like in a presidential election, Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) or a two-round system works well. RCV lets voters rank candidates, ensuring the winner has over 50% support after redistributing votes. A two-round system, like runoffs, does the same but may take more time. For example, RCV is used in some U.S. cities for mayoral elections ([FairVote](https://fairvote.org/)).

#### Multi-Winner Elections (e.g., Parliament, City Council)  
For elections where you need fair representation of different groups, like in a parliament, Proportional Representation (PR) systems are best. Single Transferable Vote (STV) or Party List PR ensures seats match vote shares, reflecting diverse opinions. STV is used in Ireland for parliamentary elections, while Party List PR is common in Europe ([Electoral Reform Society](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/)).

#### Simple Decisions (e.g., Referendums, Budget Votes)  
For yes/no choices, like a city budget vote, a simple majority vote—where the option with more than 50% wins—is straightforward and efficient. It's widely used in referendums, like Brexit, for clear outcomes.

#### Consensus-Building (e.g., Organizational Decisions)  
When a group, like a board, needs near-unanimity, a supermajority vote (e.g., 75% approval) or consensus decision-making can work. These take longer but ensure broad agreement, though they may exclude minority views.

#### Choosing from Multiple Options (e.g., Company Logo, Project)  
An unexpected detail: for picking from several options, like a new company logo, RCV can help by letting voters rank choices, ensuring the most preferred option wins, not just the most first-choice votes. This avoids splitting votes among similar options.

Each system has trade-offs, so consider your scenario's goals. For instance, RCV is great for fairness but can be complex for voters, while simple majority voting is fast but may not reflect all preferences.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Voting Systems for Various Scenarios

This note provides a comprehensive analysis of voting systems, tailored to different scenarios, drawing on political science, decision theory, and practical examples. It expands on the direct answer, offering a detailed exploration for readers seeking depth, including historical context, comparative ratings, and nuanced considerations.

#### Introduction to Voting Systems  
Voting systems are methods for aggregating individual preferences to make collective decisions, used in political elections, organizational choices, and group decisions. The "best" system depends on the scenario's goals, such as ensuring majority support, proportional representation, or simplicity. This analysis covers common systems like First-Past-The-Post (FPTP), Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV), Proportional Representation (PR), and others, evaluating their suitability across scenarios.

#### Categorization of Scenarios and Recommended Systems  
To organize the analysis, scenarios are grouped by purpose, with corresponding voting systems rated based on criteria like proportionality, voter choice, and local representation, as informed by sources like the Electoral Reform Society ([Electoral Reform Society](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/)). Below, we detail each scenario, supported by examples and ratings.

##### Single-Winner Elections Requiring Majority Support  
- **Scenarios:** Electing a president, mayor, or organizational leader where broad support is crucial.  
- **Goal:** Ensure the winner has over 50% support to legitimize their mandate.  
- **Recommended Systems:** Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV, also known as Alternative Vote in some contexts) or a two-round system (e.g., runoffs).  
- **Rationale:** RCV allows voters to rank candidates, redistributing votes from eliminated candidates until one achieves a majority, avoiding "spoiler" effects. A two-round system holds a second election between the top two candidates if no majority is reached initially. Both systems address the limitation of FPTP, where a candidate can win with less than 50% (e.g., 34% in a three-candidate race).  
- **Example:** RCV is used in cities like San Francisco for mayoral elections ([FairVote](https://fairvote.org/)), while France uses a two-round system for presidential elections.  
- **Ratings (from Electoral Reform Society):** RCV scores 2 stars for proportionality, 4 for voter choice, and 5 for local representation, making it versatile for single-winner contexts.  

##### Multi-Winner Elections for Proportional Representation  
- **Scenarios:** Electing parliaments, city councils, or committees where diverse representation is key.  
- **Goal:** Ensure seat allocation reflects vote shares, representing various groups or parties.  
- **Recommended Systems:** Proportional Representation (PR) systems, specifically Single Transferable Vote (STV) or Party List PR.  
- **Rationale:** STV uses multi-member districts with ranked ballots, allocating seats proportionally while allowing voter choice among candidates. Party List PR allocates seats based on party vote shares, often with closed or open lists. Both outperform FPTP, which can lead to "wasted votes" for smaller parties.  
- **Example:** Ireland uses STV for parliamentary elections, ensuring proportional representation, while Germany uses Party List PR for the Bundestag ([Electoral Reform Society](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/)).  
- **Ratings:** STV scores 5 stars for proportionality and voter choice, 4 for local representation; Party List PR scores 5 for proportionality, 2 for voter choice and local representation, highlighting trade-offs in candidate accountability.  

##### Simple Decisions: Binary or Limited Options  
- **Scenarios:** Referendums, budget approvals, or yes/no organizational votes.  
- **Goal:** Quick, clear outcomes with minimal complexity.  
- **Recommended Systems:** Simple majority vote or plurality voting.  
- **Rationale:** A simple majority vote requires over 50% for passage, ideal for binary choices like referendums (e.g., Brexit). Plurality voting, where the option with the most votes wins, suits scenarios with few options and no need for majority. Both are fast and easy to understand, though they may ignore nuanced preferences.  
- **Example:** The 2016 Brexit referendum used a simple majority vote, with 51.9% voting to leave the EU.  
- **Considerations:** These systems can marginalize minority views, especially in polarized contexts.  

##### Consensus-Building in Small Groups  
- **Scenarios:** Board decisions, cooperative policies, or community agreements needing broad support.  
- **Goal:** High agreement to ensure legitimacy and reduce conflict.  
- **Recommended Systems:** Supermajority vote (e.g., 75% approval) or consensus decision-making.  
- **Rationale:** Supermajority votes require more than a simple majority, ensuring broad buy-in, while consensus seeks unanimous agreement, often through discussion. Both are time-intensive but critical for decisions with long-term impact, like constitutional amendments.  
- **Example:** U.S. state constitutions often require supermajority votes for tax increases, ensuring broad legislative support. Consensus is common in cooperatives, like worker-owned businesses, for policy decisions.  
- **Challenges:** Consensus can exclude minority views if not managed carefully, and supermajority votes may lead to gridlock.  

##### Selecting from Multiple Options with Ranked Preferences  
- **Scenarios:** Choosing a company logo, project funding, or award winner from several options.  
- **Goal:** Identify the most preferred option, considering voter rankings to avoid vote splitting.  
- **Recommended Systems:** Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) or pairwise comparison methods (e.g., Condorcet).  
- **Rationale:** RCV redistributes votes from least preferred options, ensuring the winner reflects broader support, not just first choices. Pairwise comparisons pit each option against others, selecting the one that wins most head-to-head matchups. This is particularly useful when options are similar, preventing "spoiler" effects.  
- **Example:** Some organizations use RCV for internal awards, like "Employee of the Year," to ensure the winner is broadly accepted. Pairwise methods are used in academic settings for ranking research proposals.  
- **Unexpected Detail:** RCV's application here extends beyond politics, offering a nuanced approach to corporate or community decisions, which may surprise readers expecting simpler methods like plurality voting.  

#### Comparative Analysis Using Ratings  
To further illustrate, here's a table of voting system ratings based on the Electoral Reform Society's criteria, which helps identify the best fit for each scenario:

| **Voting System**   | **Proportionality** | **Voter Choice** | **Local Representation** |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) | 1 star             | 2 stars          | 5 stars                  |
| Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV/AV) | 2 stars            | 4 stars          | 5 stars                  |
| Single Transferable Vote (STV) | 5 stars            | 5 stars          | 4 stars                  |
| Party List PR       | 5 stars            | 2 stars          | 2 stars                  |
| Additional Member System (AMS) | 4 stars           | 3 stars          | 4 stars                  |

- **Interpretation:** For high proportionality (e.g., parliaments), STV and Party List PR lead. For local representation (e.g., local elections), FPTP and RCV excel. This table aids in matching systems to scenario priorities, acknowledging trade-offs like voter choice versus proportionality.

#### Additional Considerations and Nuances  
- **Strategic Voting:** Some systems, like RCV, are designed to reduce incentives for strategic voting, where voters misrepresent preferences to influence outcomes. However, systems like FPTP are more vulnerable, potentially skewing results in multi-candidate races.  
- **Scalability and Complexity:** Simple systems like majority voting scale well for large elections, while consensus processes are better for small groups. RCV, while fair, can be complex for voters, requiring education, which may limit its adoption in less literate populations.  
- **Recent Trends:** While the analysis focuses on voting methods, recent developments in electronic voting (e.g., blockchain for security) highlight infrastructure, not method changes. These do not alter the suitability of systems like RCV or PR but emphasize secure implementation ([AAAS](https://www.aaas.org/epi-center/future-voting-technology)).  
- **Cultural and Contextual Factors:** The "best" system also depends on cultural norms, like voter literacy or trust in institutions. For instance, PR systems may face resistance in countries with strong two-party traditions, favoring FPTP despite its disproportionality.  

#### Conclusion  
This analysis shows that no voting system is universally best; each fits specific scenarios based on goals like fairness, efficiency, or consensus. For single-winner elections, RCV or two-round systems ensure majority support; for multi-winner elections, PR systems like STV or Party List PR ensure representation. Simple decisions favor majority or plurality voting, while consensus-building uses supermajority or consensus processes. For nuanced choices, RCV offers a flexible approach, extending beyond politics to corporate decisions, which may surprise readers. This comprehensive view, supported by ratings and examples, aids in selecting the right system for any context.
