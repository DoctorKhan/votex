# Community Discussion Board Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a general community discussion board in the Votex system. This feature will provide a dedicated space for community-wide discussions that aren't tied to specific proposals, allowing for broader engagement, knowledge sharing, and community building.

## Core Functionality

The community discussion board will provide:

1. A central hub for general discussions about voting, governance, and related topics
2. Category-based organization of discussions
3. Thread creation and response capabilities
4. User profiles and activity tracking
5. Moderation tools for community management

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Model Changes

#### A. New Forum Entities

```typescript
export type ForumCategoryEntity = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  sortOrder: number;
  createdAt: number;
  lastActivityAt: number;
  threadCount: number;
};

export type ForumThreadEntity = {
  id: string;
  categoryId: string;
  title: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: number;
  lastReplyAt: number;
  replyCount: number;
  viewCount: number;
  isPinned: boolean;
  isLocked: boolean;
  tags?: string[];
};

export type ForumPostEntity = {
  id: string;
  threadId: string;
  content: string;
  userId: string;
  username?: string;
  createdAt: number;
  editedAt?: number;
  reactions?: Record<string, string[]>; // Emoji key to array of user IDs
  isModeratorPost?: boolean;
};
```

#### B. Database Schema Updates

- Add new IndexedDB stores for forum categories, threads, and posts
- Create appropriate indexes for efficient querying
- Set up relationships between entities

### 2. Service Layer Changes

#### A. Create Forum Service

Create a new service (`src/lib/forumService.ts`) with the following capabilities:

- Category management (create, update, list)
- Thread operations (create, update, lock, pin)
- Post functionality (create, edit, delete)
- View tracking
- Reaction management
- Moderation capabilities

#### B. User Profile Extensions

Update the user system to include:

- Forum activity statistics
- User preferences for forum notifications
- User role specifications (regular user, moderator, admin)

### 3. UI Component Implementation

#### A. Main Forum Components

Create the following components:

- `ForumLayout.tsx`: Overall layout for the forum section
- `CategoryList.tsx`: Display and navigation for categories
- `ThreadList.tsx`: List of threads in a category
- `ThreadView.tsx`: Individual thread with posts
- `PostEditor.tsx`: Rich text editor for creating/editing posts
- `UserForumProfile.tsx`: Forum-specific user profile view

#### B. Navigation and Discovery

- Add forum navigation items to the main application navigation
- Implement a forum activity feed on the homepage
- Create a forum search functionality

#### C. Moderation Tools

- Develop moderation queue for flagged content
- Create interfaces for category and thread management
- Build user management tools

### 4. Integration Points

#### A. Notifications

- Create notification system for thread replies and mentions
- Implement email notifications (optional)
- Add in-app notification indicators

#### B. Integration with Proposal System

- Add links between relevant forum discussions and proposals
- Allow referencing proposals in forum posts
- Create unified search across proposals and forum content

### 5. User Experience Design

#### A. Information Architecture

- Design category structure based on anticipated discussion topics
- Create consistent navigation patterns
- Implement breadcrumbs for context awareness

#### B. Interaction Design

- Design responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Implement keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Create loading states and transitions

#### C. Visual Design

- Develop forum-specific styling that integrates with the application design system
- Create icons and visual indicators for thread status
- Design user badges and reputation indicators

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

- Implement basic data models and services
- Create essential UI components (category list, thread list, thread view)
- Build simple post creation and reply functionality
- Set up database schema and basic queries

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

- Add rich text editing with formatting options
- Implement reactions and thread status management
- Create user profiles and activity tracking
- Build thread subscription and notification features

### Phase 3: Moderation and Management

- Implement moderation queue and tools
- Add reporting functionality
- Create analytics dashboard for forum activity
- Build advanced search and filtering

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Implement pagination for thread lists and post views
- Use virtual scrolling for long threads
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Security

- Ensure proper input sanitization for user-generated content
- Implement appropriate authorization checks for moderation actions
- Create audit logs for sensitive operations

### Accessibility

- Ensure all forum components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement proper keyboard navigation
- Use appropriate ARIA attributes for custom controls
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and text sizing

### Offline Support

- Implement draft saving for posts being composed
- Provide read-only access to previously loaded forum content when offline
- Queue post actions for synchronization when connection is restored

## Future Enhancements

- Private messaging system
- Advanced formatting options (code blocks, tables)
- File attachments and image uploads
- Polls and voting within threads
- Thread categorization with tags
- User reputation system
- Advanced moderation tools (automated content filtering)

## Migration and Launch Strategy

1. Develop and test the forum system in a staging environment
2. Create initial categories and seed content before public launch
3. Perform security and performance testing
4. Launch with a beta period for feedback collection
5. Iterate based on user feedback

## Conclusion

The community discussion board will provide a valuable space for general discussions, complementing the proposal-specific discussions already in the system. This implementation plan outlines a phased approach to building a full-featured forum while maintaining integration with the existing Votex platform.
