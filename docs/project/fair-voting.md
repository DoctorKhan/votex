# Comparing Single-Winner Voting Methods

This page compares the most commonly discussed single-winner voting methods in the United States and rates each method on key metrics. Of countless possible evaluation criteria, this page focuses on those that most impact the voter experience and deliver outcomes that reflect the will of the voters. No criterion, however, is more important than voters accepting the system on its terms and using it. 

Below is a summary table of the main methods (see descriptions and justifications for each category further down):

| **Method**          | **Well-tested in Government Elections?**                                                                 | **Resistance to Strategic Voting**                                           | **Resistance to Spoilers**                            | **Majority Cohesion**                                                                 | **Condorcet Efficiency**                                                        | **Simplicity of Tabulation**                             | **Descriptive Representation**                                                               | **Compatibility With Fair Multi-Winner Elections**                                |

| **Plurality**       | **Yes.** Currently used across the U.S. and historically in most single-winner elections.                                                  | **Weak.** Strong incentives to vote insincerely (“compromise”) if your favorite is not a front-runner.              | **Very vulnerable.** Minor “spoiler” candidates can split support from frontrunners.      | **Limited.** Only works when a majority unites behind a single candidate.        | **Fails** in many cases; no guarantee a “beats-all” candidate wins.               | **Very simple.** One tally per candidate, highest total wins.                     | **Poor.** Historically yields poor representation rates for women & candidates of color.       | **Difficult.** There is no form of plurality that naturally ensures proportional representation. |
| **Two-Round Runoff**| **Yes.** Common worldwide (e.g., some mayoral and presidential races), though less used in the U.S. for legislative offices.               | **Moderate.** Reduces some incentive for compromise, though still possible in crowded fields.                        | **Partly resistant.** Spoiler effect can occur if multiple similar candidates prevent each other from making the runoff. | **Better than plurality.** Eventually unifies the top two but does not always protect majorities split among 3+.     | **Usually good.** Often elects the Condorcet winner, though it can fail if the Condorcet candidate finishes third.      | **Simple.** Tally all votes; if no majority, repeat with the top two.              | **Mixed.** Runoffs can depress turnout for marginalized groups, making representation tricky.   | **Not ideal.** Two-round runoff isn’t typically used as a building block for proportional systems. |
| **Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)** <br/>*(aka Instant Runoff or Preferential Voting)* | **Yes.** Used in many U.S. cities & states (e.g., Maine, Alaska), plus Australia & Ireland in single-winner form.      | **High.** Later choices cannot harm earlier ones (“later-no-harm”). Rarely compromised in real elections.            | **Strong.** Generally satisfies “no spoiler” criteria; a minor candidate’s votes transfer if they lose.               | **Excellent.** Satisfies the “Mutual Majority” criterion—cohesive majorities always elect one of their preferred. | **Very high (99.6%).** In practice, RCV almost always elects a “beats-all” winner if one exists. | **More complex.** Requires a multi-round elimination process but is easily handled by modern machines. | **Strong.** Research shows RCV helps elect more women & people of color and eliminates “vote-splitting” within groups. | **High.** RCV extends naturally to multi-winner “Single Transferable Vote (STV)” for proportional representation.         |
| **Approval Voting** | **Rare in government elections.** A few local U.S. jurisdictions have recently experimented with it.                                     | **Weak.** Highly vulnerable to “bullet voting” and “burying” strategies.                                          | **Better than plurality** if voters “approve” a frontrunner to block spoilers. But it relies heavily on strategic behavior.   | **No guarantee.** A majority can be undermined by strategic bullet voting or partial approvals.                    | **Fails** the Condorcet loser criterion in many scenarios.                            | **Simple sums.** Each candidate’s tally is the count of approvals, highest total wins.        | **Unknown.** Unproven in practice to boost representation among historically marginalized groups. | **Poor–Moderate.** Multi-winner approval does not guarantee fair proportional outcomes.          |
| **Score Voting**    | **Unproven in major government elections.** Has niche usage (e.g. some private polls).                                                   | **Weak.** Voters can “bury” strong rivals or “bullet vote” for their favorite.                                      | **Better than plurality** if voters use top scores to protect a frontrunner, but also reliant on strategic guesswork.   | **No guarantee.** A cohesive majority can fail to elect its choice due to strategic scoring or splitting.           | **Fails** the Condorcet criterion and can elect a Condorcet loser in theory.         | **Moderate.** Tally the numeric scores, highest average wins.                      | **Unknown.** No real-world usage data to confirm improved election of women & people of color.  | **Poor–Moderate.** Multi-winner variants do not necessarily produce proportional representation.  |
| **STAR Voting** <br/>*(Score-Then-Automatic-Runoff)* | **Unproven in major government elections.** Tested in limited private or advocacy-run elections.                      | **Moderate.** Some bullet-voting & burying incentives remain.                 | **Better than score** but still vulnerable if a strong rival can be “buried” so they miss the final runoff.            | **No guarantee.** Similar to score voting, it does not systematically protect cohesive majorities.               | **Fails** the Condorcet criterion. Can also elect a Condorcet loser in certain scenarios.         | **Moderate–Complex.** Requires sum of scores, then a separate “runoff” count.      | **Unknown.** No widespread usage data on descriptive-representation benefits.       | **Poor–Moderate.** STAR multi-winner versions don’t guarantee proportional representation.       |
| **Condorcet Methods** | **Not used in U.S. governmental elections.** Some examples in private organizations or overseas experiments.                            | **Mixed.** Generally vulnerable to “burying” and other sophisticated strategies.                                   | **Typically good.** If a consistent Condorcet winner exists, they will defeat any spoiler in head-to-head matchups.     | **Excellent** if there’s a majority candidate who is also a Condorcet winner; can fail if no Condorcet winner exists. | **Perfect** if a single Condorcet winner exists, because that candidate always wins. | **More complex** to implement & explain; requires many head-to-head tallies.        | **Unknown.** No real-world usage data in diverse or large-scale public elections.    | **Varies** by exact Condorcet approach. Usually no straightforward adaptation to multi-winner.   |

## Introduction

The three most common methods in the United States are **plurality voting** (called “first past the post” voting), **two-round runoffs**, and **ranked choice voting** (RCV, also called “preferential voting” or “instant runoff voting”). Other methods have not yet been widely tested or gained traction in the U.S.

This chart compares the most widely discussed single-winner voting methods. Of countless possible evaluation criteria, this chart focuses on those that most impact the voter experience and deliver outcomes that reflect the will of the voters. No criterion, however, is more important than voters accepting the system on its terms and using it.

## Criteria: Well-Tested in Government Elections

**Has the method been tested in real, competitive elections for public office?** This attests to its viability for adoption and the degree to which it is a “known quantity”—without the potential for unintended consequences.

- **RCV, two-round runoff, and plurality voting** are the only methods that have been used extensively in competitive elections around the world. A wealth of evidence speaks to how these methods behave in real-world contexts.
- **Approval voting** in its multi-winner form has been used in occasional municipal elections in the United States with mixed success. 
- **Condorcet methods, score,** and **STAR voting** have never been used in a public election for government office, so claims about their behavior in practice remain unproven. Also, proposals for methods with no track record face the political hurdle of asking jurisdictions to become “guinea pigs.”

## Criteria: Resistant to Strategic Voting

**All voting methods are vulnerable** to some form of strategic manipulation, but they differ in how strongly they incentivize strategic voting and how likely voters are to use the strategy. Four common types of strategic voting are:

1. **Bullet voting:** insincerely expressing a preference for only a single candidate to increase that candidate’s chance of victory.  
2. **Burying:** insincerely expressing a lower preference for a candidate to reduce their chance of winning.  
3. **Compromising:** insincerely expressing a higher preference for a candidate seen as more likely to win.  
4. **Pushing-over:** insincerely expressing a higher preference for a weaker (or “push-over”) candidate so that they defeat a stronger opponent—hoping your real favorite will later defeat that push-over candidate.

- **RCV** is highly resistant to strategic manipulation and immune to the most common tactics of bullet-voting and burying. It can in rare cases be vulnerable to compromising, but there is no real-world evidence of voters employing the more extreme “push-over” tactic in RCV.
- **Plurality** strongly incentivizes strategic compromising (voting for a perceived front-runner rather than one’s real favorite).
- **Two-round runoff** reduces some compromise incentives compared to plurality, but not entirely, especially in crowded races.
- **Approval and score voting** are highly vulnerable to bullet voting, compromising, and burying.
- **STAR voting** partially mitigates bullet-voting incentives but is still somewhat vulnerable to burying (voters might try to ensure a strong rival does not advance to the final runoff).
- **Condorcet methods** are also vulnerable to burying and other sophisticated strategies.

## Criteria: Resistance to Spoilers

**How well does the method prevent a minor candidate from “spoiling” a similar front-runner candidate’s chances via vote-splitting?**

- **RCV** is highly resistant because it satisfies both the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives and Independence of Clones criteria; minor-candidate votes can transfer to a front-runner. 
- **Plurality** is notoriously vulnerable to spoilers.
- **Two-round runoff** is somewhat resistant but still can fail if multiple similar candidates prevent each other from getting into the top-two runoff.
- **Approval and score voting** are more resistant than plurality in principle—if voters are willing to approve or give high scores to a front-runner. But that relies on accurate polling data, a clear set of two front-runners, and a willingness to use maximum scores for compromise. Without those, the spoiler effect can persist.
- **STAR voting** is more resistant than approval or score alone, but still susceptible to burying strategies that can spoil a strong rival out of the final round.

## Criteria: Majority Cohesion

**How well does the method reflect the will of cohesive political majorities?**

- **RCV** perfectly satisfies the Mutual Majority Criterion: if a majority of voters shares a preference set, one of their preferred candidates must win.
- **Plurality** only satisfies the weaker Majority Criterion when a majority unites behind a single candidate. Splitting among multiple candidates undermines that majority.
- **Two-round runoff** satisfies the basic Majority Criterion but not the Mutual Majority Criterion when multiple candidates split majority support.
- **Approval, score,** and **STAR** do not guarantee that a cohesive majority can always elect one of its preferred candidates; these methods can elect a candidate without majority support.
- **Condorcet methods** generally satisfy mutual majority requirements if a Condorcet winner exists, though certain Condorcet variants can be ambiguous when no Condorcet winner emerges.

---

## Criteria: Condorcet Efficiency

**How often does the method elect the candidate who would win a head-to-head contest against every other candidate (the “beats-all” or Condorcet winner), when one exists?**

- **Condorcet methods** always elect the Condorcet winner (if one exists) by definition.
- **RCV** does not formally satisfy the Condorcet criterion but almost always elects the Condorcet winner in practice. Of hundreds of RCV elections in the U.S., only a tiny handful have failed to elect the Condorcet winner.
- **Two-round runoff** also tends to elect the Condorcet winner, although it can fail if that candidate initially finishes behind two others and doesn’t make the runoff.
- **Plurality, approval, score,** and **STAR** do not guarantee avoidance of a Condorcet loser (a candidate who would lose any head-to-head matchup) and can fail to elect the Condorcet winner.

---

## Criteria: Simplicity of Tabulation

**How simple is it to count the ballots and determine a winner?**

- **Plurality, two-round runoff,** and **approval** require only adding up votes (or approvals) per candidate and are therefore the simplest.
- **Score** and **STAR** involve summing numeric scores, which is straightforward but slightly more involved than a simple “one vote per candidate” approach.
- **RCV and Condorcet** both require more complex algorithms—multiple rounds of elimination for RCV, and pairwise head-to-head tallies for Condorcet. Modern voting machines can handle this automatically, but the process is more elaborate to explain.

---

## Criteria: Descriptive Representation

**How well does the method promote the election of candidates from diverse backgrounds and demographics (race, ethnicity, gender, etc.)?**

- **RCV** has demonstrably improved representation for women and people of color, encouraging more diverse fields of candidates and eliminating the “win penalty” from splitting.
- **Plurality** has yielded candidates that do not reflect overall population diversity.
- **Two-round runoff** can help “consolidate” races, but research shows that turnout often dips more for voters of color in the runoff phase, making gains uncertain.
- **Approval, score, STAR,** and **Condorcet** have little or no real-world evidence to show whether they improve or diminish representation; none have been widely used in diverse public races.

---

## Criteria: Compatibility with Fair Multi-Winner Elections

**How easily does the single-winner method extend to a proportional or fair multi-winner system?**

- **RCV** can directly extend to the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method for multi-winner elections, which is widely recognized as a form of proportional representation.
- **Two-round runoff** rarely extends to multi-winner elections in practice.
- **Plurality** can be used for multi-winner contests, but it typically leads to block-voting or “at-large” seats that fail to provide fair representation for minority groups.
- **Approval, score,** and **STAR** can be adapted for multiple winners, but those variants generally do not guarantee proportional outcomes.
- **Condorcet** does not have a straightforward multi-winner extension for proportional representation.
