# Implementation and Test-Driven Development Plan for Ranked Choice Voting

## 1. Overview

The current implementation supports a simple majority voting system where users can cast a single vote for a proposal. To implement Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), we need to modify the existing architecture to allow users to rank their preferences and implement the necessary logic to calculate winners using the RCV algorithm.

    class VoteEntity {
        +string id
        +string userId
        +string[] rankedProposalIds
        +number timestamp
        +string verificationHash
    }
    
    class RoundResult {
        +number roundNumber
        +Map~string, number~ voteCount
        +string eliminatedProposalId
        +Map~string, number~ transferredVotes
    }
    
    class ElectionResult {
        +string winningProposalId
        +number majorityThreshold
        +RoundResult[] rounds
        +boolean isComplete
    }
```

## 5. Test-Driven Development Plan

### 5.1 Unit Tests

#### Vote Entity Tests

```typescript
describe('RankedVoteEntity', () => {
  test('should create a valid ranked vote with multiple preferences', () => {
    // Test code
  });

  test('should validate rankings are in correct order', () => {
    // Test code
  });

  test('should reject votes with duplicate proposals', () => {
    // Test code
  });
});
```

#### RCV Algorithm Tests

```typescript
describe('RankedChoiceVotingEngine', () => {
  test('should correctly determine winner when majority achieved in first round', () => {
    // Test code with predetermined votes and expected winner
  });

  test('should correctly eliminate candidates and transfer votes', () => {
    // Test code with multiple rounds scenario
  });

  test('should handle tie scenarios according to defined rules', () => {
    // Test code with tie scenario
  });

  test('should correctly process elections with exactly two candidates', () => {
    // Test code
  });
});
```

#### Service Layer Tests

```typescript
describe('VotingService - RCV', () => {
  test('should allow user to submit ranked votes', () => {
    // Test code
  });

  test('should prevent user from voting twice in same election', () => {
    // Test code
  });

  test('should calculate and return correct election results', () => {
    // Test code
  });
});
```

### 5.2 Integration Tests

```typescript
describe('RCV Integration', () => {
  test('should correctly process votes and determine winner through multiple rounds', () => {
    // Test election with multiple voters and rounds
  });

  test('should handle large number of proposals and votes efficiently', () => {
    // Performance test with many votes
  });

    // Test results display
  });
});
```

## 6. Detailed Implementation Sequence

### Step 1: Update VoteEntity and Database Structure

```typescript
// Enhanced VoteEntity
export interface RankedVoteEntity {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  rankedProposalIds: string[]; // Ordered array of proposal IDs
  timestamp: number;
  verificationHash?: string;
}

// Round result for storing interim results
export interface RoundResult {
  roundNumber: number;
  voteCount: Record<string, number>;
  eliminatedProposalId: string | null;
  transferredVotes: Record<string, number>;
}

// Overall election result
export interface ElectionResult {
  electionId: string;
  winningProposalId: string | null;
  majorityThreshold: number;
  rounds: RoundResult[];
  isComplete: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### Step 2: Create RCV Algorithm Core

```typescript
export class RankedChoiceVotingEngine {
  /**
   * Process an election using RCV algorithm
   * @param votes Array of ranked votes
   * @param proposals Array of proposals
   * @returns Election result with all rounds
   */
  processElection(votes: RankedVoteEntity[], proposals: ProposalEntity[]): ElectionResult {
    // Implementation of RCV algorithm
    // 1. Count first-preference votes
    // 2. Check if any proposal has majority
    // 3. If not, eliminate proposal with fewest votes
    // 4. Transfer votes to next preferences
    // 5. Repeat until majority achieved
  }
  
  /**
   * Count votes for a specific round
   * @param votes Votes to count
   * @param eliminatedProposals Proposals already eliminated
   * @returns Vote counts per proposal
   */
  countVotesForRound(
    votes: RankedVoteEntity[],
    eliminatedProposals: string[]
  ): Record<string, number> {
    // Count votes, skipping eliminated proposals
  }
  
  /**
   * Find proposal to eliminate based on fewest votes
   * @param voteCounts Current vote counts
   * @returns ID of proposal to eliminate
   */
  findProposalToEliminate(voteCounts: Record<string, number>): string {
    // Find proposal with fewest votes
  }
  
  /**
   * Transfer votes from eliminated proposal
   * @param votes All votes
   * @param eliminatedProposalId Proposal being eliminated
   * @param alreadyEliminated Previously eliminated proposals
   * @returns New vote count after transfer
   */
  transferVotes(
    votes: RankedVoteEntity[],
    eliminatedProposalId: string,
    alreadyEliminated: string[]
  ): Record<string, number> {
    // Transfer votes to next preferences
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Update VotingService with RCV Support

```typescript
export class VotingService {
  // Existing methods...
  
  /**
   * Submit a ranked vote for multiple proposals
   * @param rankedProposalIds Ordered array of proposal IDs
   * @param userId The ID of the user voting
   * @returns Promise that resolves with the vote result
   */
  async submitRankedVote(
    rankedProposalIds: string[],
    userId: string
  ): Promise<{ success: boolean; voteId: string | null }> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  /**
   * Process an election using RCV
   * @param electionId ID of the election to process
   * @returns Promise that resolves with the election results
   */
  async processRankedChoiceElection(
    electionId: string
  ): Promise<ElectionResult> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  /**
   * Get current standings in an ongoing election
   * @param electionId ID of the election
   * @returns Promise that resolves with current results
   */
  async getCurrentElectionStandings(
    electionId: string
  ): Promise<ElectionResult> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```
